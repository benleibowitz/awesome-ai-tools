## Quick Start

If you're new to AI tooling and want some simple, easy ways to get your feet wet, I recommend:
- [Cursor](#cursor) - an IDE with AI
- [Warp](#warp) - an terminal with AI
- [Perplexity](#perplexity) - smarter web search
- [Claude Desktop](#claude-desktop) + a [simple filesystem MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem#usage-with-claude-desktop) to get started with MCP
  - Ask Claude "what files are in my downloads folder?" or "write a simple Python script in my Downloads folder"

## AI Models
